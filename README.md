I2cMaster-Particle is a beta library for [Particle](https://www.particle.io/) development boards.

It has only been tested on Photon.

Expect bugs.

## Examples

I included the two examples I used for development.

I2cMasterTest.cpp in firmware/examples folder.

MPU6050 tests in the mpu6050test folder.
